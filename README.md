### My Story  
I started my career in software engineering, building and supporting enterprise systems at Accenture. Writing code and solving technical problems was rewarding, but what really excited me was asking: *‚ÄúWhy are we solving this in the first place?‚Äù*  

That curiosity pulled me from pure coding into business analysis, where I focused on gathering requirements, translating stakeholder chaos into user stories, and running UATs, and eventually into data.  

Now, as a graduate student in Business Analytics at UMass Amherst, I‚Äôve gone deep into SQL queries, Power BI dashboards, and Python models, while continuing to build on my enterprise systems background. I still love building things, but even more, I love connecting the dots between data, systems, and business problems.

### Things I Geek Out On  
- Writing SQL queries that make messy data elegant  
- Automating manual tasks with scripts and workflows  
- Building dashboards that stakeholders actually use  
- Feature engineering for ML models (and debating hyperparameters late at night)  
- Turning business chaos into structured, testable solutions
